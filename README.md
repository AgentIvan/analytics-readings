# Resources for Analytics Engineers (Still Work in Progress)
This repository is a curation of good blog posts and books for Analytics Engineers. It can also be very useful for Data Analysts and Data Scientists. It's not aimed toward total beginners (don't know SQL).

## Contribute
I really appreciate any contribution. Just make sure to write a couple of lines to describe the theme and why you found the resource useful.
